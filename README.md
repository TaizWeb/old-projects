# old-projects
These are some of my oldest projects I've ever created. I made this repository for historical reasons, for any ~~stalkers~~ admirers I may have interested in where I started. Below is a breakdown of what everything is and what it does.

## Pynary
My first foray into Python. After a friend of mine on Twitter kept jokingly posting in binary, I though it'd be cool to write a quick script to translate back and forth. This is the result.

## blog
My (formerly) biggest project. A blog, built on Node.js, in particular, MEAN stack. It featured a complete admin backend to write, submit, edit, and delete posts on the site. It's not live anywhere anymore, but if I manage to find the posts I wrote, I'll stick them in the repo as well.

## hexmsg
This was one of my more interesting projects to date. Hexmsg is an anonymous instant messaging service built on websockets, with a Node.js backend. All messages in real-time, and you got a randomly colored text bubble depending on whatever your IP hashed out to be. Towards the end of development I added a few commands, emojis, and a mobile UI to the service, but it was ultimately abandoned. However, it is still "live" on the internet, refer to Hexmsg's README for the URL.

## sc-discord-bot
This was a discord bot for a server I used to run. This project didn't get very far. It had a few "fun" commands to it, along with a role-manager. Ultimately abandoned, though still usable(?).
