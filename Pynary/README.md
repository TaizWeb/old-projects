# Pynary
**Disclaimer**: Yes, I know Python supports bitwise operations normally, however I decided to make this anyway.

Pynary is a simple tool that translates ASCII binary into normal text using a 128-word dictionary (letters.json).

## Usage:
Pynary can be used from the command line by executing:
```
$ python main.py <binary here>
```
or
```
$ ./main.py <binary here>
```

Pynary can also read external files using -f:
```
$ python main.py -f <path/to/text.txt>
```
or
```
$ ./main.py -f <path/to/text.txt>
```
